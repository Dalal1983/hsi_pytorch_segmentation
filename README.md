# HSI PyTorch Segmentation
Semantic image segmentation on hyperspectral remote sensing scenes using PyTorch.

## Status
In development, not working.

## Project Information
Out of curiosity to work with HSI data, a semantic segmentation algorithm using custom ResNet architectures is to be implemented with PyTorch.
